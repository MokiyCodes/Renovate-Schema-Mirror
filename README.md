# Renovate-Schema-Mirror
[Mirrors](https://mokiycodes.github.io/Renovate-Schema-Mirror/schema.json) Renovate's [Config Schema](https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json).

## Why?
1. To be able to detect schema changes, and;
2. Due to VSC being unwilling to load it from it's original URL for some reason.
